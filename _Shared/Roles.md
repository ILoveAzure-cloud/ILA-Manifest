# Roles in "I Love Azure"

# Contributor

This is the first and the most important role for ILA.

The contributor is the one that create the video content to publish on the YouTube channel of ILA.

The number of contents that a contributor can create depends only from the contributor himself/herself. There is not a minimum or maximum range of contribution that could be published on ILA (even if to be enrolled as a contributor almost 1 content must be published).
