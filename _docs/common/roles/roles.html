<p>Once the Contributor has recorded the video content, he/she will upload the media file on the shared folder enabled for uploads.</p>

<p>When the media file is available, the Editor prepare the final video to publish on the YouTube channel using the content AS IS, just adding the cover page, the intro and the outro jingle.</p>
