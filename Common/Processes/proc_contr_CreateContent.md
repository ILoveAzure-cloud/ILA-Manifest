In the [processes page](..\Shared\Processes.md), there will be contributor processes explained, including new content creation guidelines.

## Tools and software to use

Content must be always recorded from the contributor, **at this moment there is no plan for live streaming** (in the future will be considered).

Contributor could use any kind of software for recording, and/or editing the content to publish.

The content could be exported in one of the most common video format, anyway **.MP4 format is preferred**.
