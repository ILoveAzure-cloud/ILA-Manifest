## How to require to become a contributor

To become a *Contributor*, candidate must send a email to *ila.org@outlook.com* with the following info:

- *(mandatory)* First and Last Name
- *(mandatory)* LinkedIn profile page URL
- *(optional)* Social presence URL (if available and not present on the LinkedIn profile), such as blogs, streaming channel or whatever candidate prefer to indicate
- *(optional)* A few topics on content he/she wants to propose for the contents
- *(mandatory)* A short *Content Sharing Agreement* which indicates that contents will be self-generated and allows the ILA community to publish these contents without any material compensation, for this agreement can be copied [this template](..\_Templates\template_csa.html).

## Contributor acceptance mail

Once the *Administrators* received the email, they will evaluate the request and will give a response in a couple of days.

If the candidate would be accepted as *Contributor* he/she will receive a "Contributor acceptance mail" with the following info:

- **Personal folder URL**
this is a OneDrive personal folder assigned to the *Contributor* to upload contents to publish; this folder must be used ONLY for contents to publish on ILA and not to host other files; *Administrators* are allowed to delete any kind of file not related to ILA contribution.
- **Telegram group LINK**
this is the link to join the private [Telegram group](..\..\main\whereis\whereis.html) of ILA community, for internal discussions and communications.

## Other information

- **Personal playlist URL**
a personal playlist on the YouTube channel with the *Contributor* contents will be created AFTER the first content publication (YouTube does not allow to create empty playlist); this playlist URL can be freely distributed from the *Contributor* to show everywhere his/her own contribution to the ILA community.

- **Contributors list enrollment**
the First and Last Name will be inserted in the [list](..\..\main\whoisin\whoisin.html) of *Contributors* on this manifest;
a series of one or more social posts could be published previous or after content publications, using the social presence to the *Contributor* when available, to amplify the social announcement.
