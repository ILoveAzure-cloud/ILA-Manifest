# Roles in "I Love Azure"

Following there is the list of roles provided for ILA initiative.

Please remember that **every role is IMPORTANT** for the success of ILA.

Once you decided to participate, be sure to understand the [processes defined for ILA](Processes.md) to achieve the role.

## Contributor

This is the first and the most important role for ILA.

The contributor is the one that create the video content to publish on the YouTube channel of ILA.

The number of contents that a contributor can create depends only from the contributor himself/herself. There is not a minimum or maximum range of contribution that could be published on ILA (even if to be enrolled as a contributor almost 1 content must be published).

## Editor

This is the role related to the content preparation for publishing.

Once the Contributor has recorded the video content, he/she will upload the media file on the shared folder enabled for uploads.

When the media file is available, the Editor prepare the final video to publish on the YouTube channel using the content AS IS, just adding the cover page, the intro and the outro jingle.

The final content available for the publishing will be moved to another shared folder accessible to the Publishers to achieve the final publication.

The Editor could publish the content too if he/she is available to cover the Publisher role too.

*Note*: The mentioned shared folders will be privately accessible ONLY to enabled people in the role.

## Publisher

The Publisher retrieve the final video content to publish from the shared folder and publish it onto the YouTube channel, adding the title and (when available) the description provided from the contributor and publish the content **immediately** (there is no scheduled regular activity for ILA).

Of course to achieve the role, the Publisher will be enabled for publishing on the ILA YouTube channel.

*Note*: The mentioned shared folders will be privately accessible ONLY to enabled people in the role.

## Social Manager

The Social Manager is able to publish posts and news to feed social presence of ILA on the web.

## Moderator

This role is still in definition. It probably will be someone available to moderate comments on ILA YouTube channel and other social media where interaction with external users is allowed.

## Administrator

This is a sort of "super user" role, enabled for all the previous roles, and able to assign or invite to roles people that wants to help the initiative.
