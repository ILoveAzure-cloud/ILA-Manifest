# Contents for *"I Love Azure"*

## Definition of content

The video content must be **short video tutorial** (or any other kind of useful explanation) about one or more *Microsoft Azure* capabilities.

Optimal content length should be **between 5 and 15 minutes**, with a desirable maximum length of around 20 minutes.

All video MUST BE in **English language**.

## Type of content

Content usually should be related to "technical" aspects such as explaination on something to achieve or configure using resources available on *Microsoft Azure*. This is the kind of content that the audience should be reasonably sure to find as created from this community.

Nonetheless the content could be related to "non-technical" aspects such as marketing, pricing, architecture, general availability announcement, public github repo or whatever could be useful in any way to the attendee to learn more about *Microsoft Azure* .

In the [processes page](../../common/processes.html), there will be contributor processes explained, including new content creation guidelines.
