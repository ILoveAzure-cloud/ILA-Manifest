# What is *"I Love Azure"*

**I Love Azure** is a new technical community whose intent is to create a **free and open knowledge base** focused on the *Microsoft Azure* cloud.

It is a sort of *"video-content centric"* community, where everyone can contribute with video contents, which will be published on the dedicated [YouTube channel](..\WhereIs\Channel.md).

The contents will be freely available to anyone, while all credits will remain with the contributor himself/herself.

The [video contents](content.md) should be short video tutorials or any other useful info about *Microsoft Azure* capabilities.

**NOTE:**
*This is a **non-profit initiative**, with just volunteer sharing with no direct or indirect earning at all, so please participate only if you are driven by an insane passion for sharing and for Azure cloud in particular.*
