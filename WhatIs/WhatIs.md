# What is *"I Love Azure"*

**I Love Azure** is a new technical community whose intent is to create a **free and open knowledge base** focused on the *Microsoft Azure* cloud.

It is a sort of *"video-content centric"* community, where everyone can contribute with video content, which will be published on the dedicated [YouTube channel](..\WhereIs\Channel.md).

The contents will be freely available to anyone, while all credits will remain with the contributor himself/herself.

The [video contents](WhatIs\content.md) should be short video tutorials or any other useful info about *Microsoft Azure* capabilities.
