# Roles in "I Love Azure"

Following there is the list of roles provided for the ILA initiative.

Please remember that **every role is IMPORTANT** for the success of ILA.

Once you decided to participate, be sure to understand the [processes defined for ILA](../processes/processes.html) to achieve the role.

## Contributor

This is the first and the most important role for ILA.

The contributor is the one that creates the video content to publish on the YouTube channel of ILA.

The number of content that a contributor can create depends only on the contributor himself/herself. There is not a minimum or maximum range of contribution that could be published on ILA (even if to be enrolled as a contributor almost 1 content must be published).

## Editor

This is the role related to the content preparation for publishing.

Once the Contributor has recorded the video content, he/she will upload the media file on the shared folder enabled for uploads.

When the media file is available, the Editor prepare the final video to publish on the YouTube channel using the content AS IS, just adding the cover page, the intro and the outro jingle.

The final content available for the publishing will be moved to another shared folder accessible to the Publishers to achieve the final publication.

The Editor could publish the content too if he/she is available to cover the Publisher role too.

*Note*: The mentioned shared folders will be privately accessible ONLY to people enrolled in the role.

## Publisher

The Publisher retrieves the final video content to publish from the shared folder and publishes it onto the YouTube channel, adding the title and (when available) the description provided by the contributor and publishing the content **immediately** (there is no scheduled regular activity for ILA).

Of course, to achieve the role, the Publisher will be enabled for publishing on the ILA YouTube channel.

*Note*: The mentioned shared folders will be privately accessible ONLY to people enrolled in the role.

## Social Manager

The Social Manager can publish posts and news to feed the social presence of ILA on the web.

## Moderator

This role is still in definition. It probably will be someone available to moderate comments on the ILA YouTube channel and other social media where interaction with external users is allowed.

## Administrator

This is a sort of "superuser" role, enabled for all the previous roles, and able to assign or invite to roles people that want to help the initiative.
